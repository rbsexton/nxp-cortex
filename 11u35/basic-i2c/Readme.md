This is a port to the LCP11U35 with MPE Forth. 

It demonstrates basic C-Forth runtime linking and interrupt
handler interoperation with forth threads.  The target application
is a simple I2C master.

This port contains a launcher that initializes
the hardware and then launches the forth interpreter.

It includes forth build files for standalone and umbilical forth.
